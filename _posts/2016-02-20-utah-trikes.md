## Old Website

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120504022540/http://www.utahtrikes.com/][0]

The original site was a static site using tables to build the layout.  The images needed updated and optimized for SEO.  Site wide changes were made to be able to search the site from any page, access social media, and link similar pages for additional product research and upsells.

## Old vs. New Product Pages
